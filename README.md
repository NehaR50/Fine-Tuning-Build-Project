# Fine-Tuned Job Title Embedding Model using Synthetic Data

This is an interactive Streamlit web application that allows users to search for job titles and discover similar job postings using both a default sentence embedding model and a fine-tuned model trained with synthetic data. This project demonstrates a domain-specific sentence embedding model for comparing job titles more effectively than general-purpose models. It uses synthetic variations of job titles (jittered titles) for fine-tuning, enabling enhanced semantic similarity detection in employment-related applications. A visual interface using Streamlit and clustering visualizations using t-SNE are also provided. It combines contrastive learning with LLM-driven data generation, offering a scalable and domain-specific alternative to traditional string matching or off-the-shelf embeddings.

## Dataset Construction

We crafted a contrastive dataset consisting of:

    seed_title: Canonical job title (e.g., "Software Engineer")
    
    jittered_title: Variant generated using LLMs (e.g., "Software Eng II (Fullstack)")
    
    onet_code: ONET job classification code for stratified splitting

Synthetic variations were generated using:

    Initial Prompting (initial_prompt.txt)
    
    Follow-Up Prompting (follow_up_prompt.txt)
    
    Intermediate Jitter Strategies (intermediate_jitter_prompt.txt)
    
    Assistant responses logged in .txt and .pkl formats.

## Model Training Summary
We fine-tuned the paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 model using triplet loss to improve job title similarity embeddings.

  ### Setup
  
  Model: paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384d)
  
  Loss: TripletLoss with margin 0.3
  
  Structure: Anchor = jittered title, Positive = seed title, Negative = random seed title
  
  Dataset: Split into train/val/test (train_ds.csv, val_ds.csv, test_ds.csv)
  
  Triplet Generation: Dynamic via IterableDataset

  ### Training Config
  
  Epochs: 5
  
  Batch Size: 64
  
  Eval per Epoch: 4 times
  
  Optimizer: AdamW with warm-up
  
  Checkpoints: Saved to fine_tuning/data/trained_models/
  
  Final Model: Saved to streamlit_app/data/fine_tuned_model/

 ## Embedding Visualization
 We used t-SNE to reduce high-dimensional embeddings (768D) to 2D.

 ## Outcome:

  Fine-tuned model forms tight, distinct clusters
  
  Default model shows more diffuse, overlapping embeddings

## Results
Improved Clustering: The fine-tuned model demonstrates tighter clustering of semantically similar job titles.

Enhanced Similarity Scores: Higher accuracy in measuring job title similarities compared to baseline models.

Interactive Exploration: The Streamlit app allows users to compare similarity scores between the default and fine-tuned models in real-time.
